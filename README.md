_I can easily achieve my goals with just dedication_

Coding goals for 2021:

* Pass all my CS classes with a decent grade (first semester completed with good results!!)
* Understand the basic concepts behind web development and create my first web applications
* Read a couple more books about specific topics, as that seems to me like the most efficient and solid way to learn a skill (currently reading about C#, Unity, Computer Graphics and Networks)
* Improve my code quality and profficiency
* Learn how to mod my favourite games and applications (Minecraft modding with Fabric, osu!lazer)
* Learn more about database systems
