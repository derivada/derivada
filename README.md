_I can easily achieve my goals with just dedication_

Coding goals for 2020/2021:

* Pass all my CS classes with a decent grade (this semester I have OOP, Algorithms & Data Structures and Databases)
* Read a couple more books about specific topics, as that seems to me like the most efficient and solid way to learn a skill 
* Improve my code quality and profficiency
* Learn how to mod my favourite games and applications (Minecraft modding for now)
* Learn some more advanced aspects from Git, my knowledge is a bit limited right now
