_I can easily achieve my goals with just dedication_

19yo student from Spain, Math & Computer Science @USC

My main motivation to learn more in this field is the pure satisfaction and joy that comes from understanding a complex system and being able to develop it further.

Coding goals for 2021 (striking ones where I have made significant progress):

* Improve my code quality and profficiency
* ~~Pass all my CS classes with a decent grade~~
* Read books about topics that I'm very interested and haven't yet been covered at uni (C#/.NET Framework, Unity, ~~JS and WebDev~~, Graphics, Networking)
* Learn more about database systems (ADO.NET, Entity Framework, Online Databases?? ...)
* ~~Understand the basic concepts behind web development~~ and create my first web applications
* ~~Complete some personal programming projects in summer 
* ~~Get a better understanding of libraries and dlls and how to interact with them~~
* Learn how to mod my favourite games and applications (Minecraft modding with Fabric, osu!lazer)
* Learn to test the speed of my programs consistently and apply techniques to optimize them further
* Learn about how video/audio/image encoding works in general and how to use them and manipulate them in a program 

Some other goals:
* Get an English C2 certificate before I finish my degree
* Get into GSOC or some other program of that kind
