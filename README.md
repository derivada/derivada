## Pablo Díaz

23yo student from Spain, BsC in Mathematics and BsC in Computer Science at Universidade de Santiago de Compostela.

My main motivation to learn more in this field is the pure satisfaction and joy that comes from understanding a complex system and being able to develop it further.

Goals for 2025:

* Dive deep into parallel and high performance computing, learn MPI and important distributed algorithms (already know CUDA and OpenMP)
* Master C++ and read into more about formal aspects of programming languages and compilers
* Setup web server and web page, current plan is to host it in a Raspberry Pi and upload some posts to it about my research interests :)
* ~Teach a course at my faculty~ (taught a 16 hour course on Introduction to the Python Language and its role in data analysis for BsC Mathematics students).
* Get a good result again at Ada Byron contest, keep improving in Competitive Programming
* Finish bachelor thesis of Mathematics on the Fast Fourier Transform and Informatics on Optimized point cloud searches with linearized octrees using Space Filling Curves
* Get accepted into a good CS Master's program

Goals for 2024:

* ~Improve in competitive programming, learn new techniques~ and reach ~1800-2000 elo in Codeforces (didn't grind Codeforces too much, only got to 1400 but won two regional competitions and our team ended 5th in Ada Byron National Programming Contest)
* Create portfolio webpage
* ~Get an internship and learn a lot on it~
* ~Come back to learning pure mathematics at uni (trying to not fail every course)~
* Master more Git and collaboration workflows, learn to use Github Actions 

Goals for 2023: 

* ~~Improve my code quality and profficiency~~
* ~~Finish the CS classes from my deegree~~
* Create a full-stack Android application
* ~~Learn a lot about software security, also about authentication protocols and services~~
* ~~Continue studying at NTNU and try to get into another exchange program for next year~~

Goals for 2022:

* ~~Improve my code quality and profficiency~~
* ~~Pass all my CS classes with a decent grade~~
* Read about topics that I'm very interested in (~~Backend stuff~~, more stuff about Operative Systems and Linux, ...)
* ~~Learn more about database systems (MongoDB, Distributed Databases?? ...)~~
* ~~Create an actual complete website (need a cool idea first tho)~~
* ~~Prepare for my Erasmus year at NTNU~~
* ~~Learn how to optimize programs to the limit by using vector instructions and assembly~~, ~~maybe even read about stuff like CUDA (done in 2024)~~
* ~~Learn about how video/audio/image encoding works in general and how to use them and manipulate them in a program~~
