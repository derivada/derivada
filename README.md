## ｄｅｒｉｖａｄａ　導関数   

_I can easily achieve my goals with just dedication_

22yo student from Spain, Math & Computer Science @USC

My main motivation to learn more in this field is the pure satisfaction and joy that comes from understanding a complex system and being able to develop it further.

Goals for 2024:

* Improve in competitive programming, learn new techniques and reach ~1800-2000 elo in Codeforces
* Create portfolio webpage
* ~Get an internship and learn a lot on it~
* ~Come back to learning pure mathematics at uni (trying to not fail every course)~
* Master more Git and collaboration workflows, learn to use Github Actions 

Goals for 2023 (striking ones where I have made significant progress): 
* ~~Improve my code quality and profficiency~~
* ~~Finish the CS classes from my deegree~~
* Create a full-stack Android application (maybe next year)
* ~~Learn a lot about software security, also about authentication protocols and services~~
* ~~Continue studying at NTNU and try to get into another exchange program for next year~~

Goals for 2022:

* ~~Improve my code quality and profficiency~~
* ~~Pass all my CS classes with a decent grade~~
* Read about topics that I'm very interested in (~~Backend stuff~~, more stuff about Operative Systems and Linux, ...)
* ~~Learn more about database systems (MongoDB, Distributed Databases?? ...)~~
* ~~Create an actual complete website (need a cool idea first tho)~~
* ~~Prepare for my Erasmus year at NTNU~~
* ~~Learn how to optimize programs to the limit by using vector instructions and assembly~~, ~~maybe even read about stuff like CUDA (done in 2024)~~
* ~~Learn about how video/audio/image encoding works in general and how to use them and manipulate them in a program~~
