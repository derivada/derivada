## ｄｅｒｉｖａｄａ　導関数   

_I can easily achieve my goals with just dedication_

21yo student from Spain, Math & Computer Science @USC

Currently studying at Trondheim, @NTNU in an Erasmus scholarship

My main motivation to learn more in this field is the pure satisfaction and joy that comes from understanding a complex system and being able to develop it further.

Coding goals for 2022 (striking ones where I have made significant progress):

* ~~Improve my code quality and profficiency~~
* ~~Pass all my CS classes with a decent grade~~
* Read about topics that I'm very interested in (~~Backend stuff~~, more stuff about Operative Systems and Linux, ...)
* ~~Learn more about database systems (MongoDB, Distributed Databases?? ...)~~
* Create an actual complete website ~~(need a cool idea first tho)~~
* ~~Prepare for my Erasmus year at NTNU~~
* ~~Learn how to optimize programs to the limit by using vector instructions and assembly~~, maybe even read about stuff like CUDA
* ~~Learn about how video/audio/image encoding works in general and how to use them and manipulate them in a program~~
